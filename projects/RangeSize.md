# Geographic Range Size

## Why study range size?
> "Of the [36-strategems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-Six_Stratagems), fleeing is best."

If we view the life history of a species as analogous to the ontogenetic development of an organism, then every species undergoes birth (origination), maturation (geographic dispersal), reproduction (speciation), and death (extinction). Each of these "stages of life" is best expressed and studied via the lens of changing geographic range size.

We know that geographic range size strongly affects the likelihood of speciation because of its link to allopatric speciation. We know that the geographic range size of a species is an indirect expression of its ecological niche, and that taxa wax and wane in geographic range size as the spatial distribution of niche-compatible environments changes through time. And, perhaps most importantly, we know that of all the [proposed determinants of extinction](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.28.1.495) (e.g., population size, fecundity, body size), only geographic range size is a strong predictor of extinction risk in *both* extant and fossil faunas.

In short, geographic range size is our best window into how *species* live and die.


## What data do I use to study geographic range size?

I use a broad suite of datasets to study geographic range size. This includes geographic range size datasets of extant taxa from the [Ocean Biogeographic Information System](www.iobis.org) and the [International Union for the Conservation of Nature](www.iucnredlist.org). Of course, as a paleobiologist, I also rely heavily upon the [Paleobiology Database](www.paleobiodb.org).

Last and perhaps most uniquely, I use the [Macrostrat Database](www.macrostrat.org) to analyze how the geographic range size of fossil species is related to both the quantity of preserved sedimentary rock and the paleogeography of ancient continents.

## What have I learned so far?

As part of my work utilizing both extant and fossil data, I have revisited the now century-old Age-and-Area hypothesis of the phytogeographer J.C.Willis. I have confirmed that not only was his much-maligned empirical prediction absolutely correct, but it is entirely consistent with other theoretical models of range size evolution and empirically observed range size patterns. You can read about my preliminary results in my [latest GSA abstract](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2015AM/webprogram/Paper269082.html), or eagerly await the publication of the manuscript.

I am also finishing up work into two prominent paleobiological hypotheses. The first by Valentine and Moores (1970), that the degree of continental dispersion (supercontinent cycling) exerts a first-order control on biodiversity. The second, by Allison and Briggs (1993) posits that our understanding of biodiversity is significantly impacted by the long-term northward migration of continents over the course of the Phanerozoic. Thanks to the Macrostrat database, we have a great deal of information about paleocontinent orientation that was not available to these original authors.

## What lies in the future?

The [Macrostrat working group](www.macrostrat.org) is putting a great deal of effort into leveraging our many geodatabases to generate forward models. This includes things like general climate models, geochemical cycling, and (most relevant to me) models of biodiversity and geographic range size as a function of paleogeography. Currently, I am building a forward model of geographic dispersion as controlled by paleocontinent location, as part of collaboration between the [Macrostrat Group](www.macrostrat.org) and [Seth Finnegan's group](https://ib.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/finnegans) at the University of California - Berkeley.
