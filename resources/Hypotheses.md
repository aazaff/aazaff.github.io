## Predictions for Paleobiology

I decided to end 2016 with a sort of exit interview. A self-evaluation of my performance over the past few years, some comments on my colleagues, and also thoughts about the overall state of Paleobiology as a field. 

What I found is that thinking deeply about the past inevitably led to thinking about the future, and that's what I'd like to share today. Below, I've outlined a few scientific hypotheses and predictions that I believe will be proven and widely accepted by paleontologists over the next three decades. My former masters advisor always suggested that I keep a notebook of hypotheses that I want to see tested so that I don't run out of ideas. I suppose that this little snippet will serve the same purpose.

### Generality of the latitudinal diversity gradient
I suspect that the latitudinal diversity gradient is a unique feature of the Cenozoic. It has not existed throughout the entirety fo the Phanerozoic, and it is likely not driven by first-order Earth processes like solar insolation (Roy et al. 1998).

I feel that the evidence for this is already fairly strong, but we'll need to unpack and define a few terms before you'll be able to fully understand my reasoning. The latitudinal diversity gradient can be described as three separate phenomena that we roll into one for convenience. 

1. The tropics, as a whole, hold more species than the extra-tropics. 
2. Some taxonomic groups exhibit a roughly bell-shaped relationship between richness and latitude. Sometimes a simple latitudinal cline is also counted. 
3. Some taxonomic groups exhibit peak diversity in a tropical bin, under some latitudinal binning scheme.

It is important to realize these three different patterns are not interchangeable, and it is quite easy, from a theoretical standpoint, to have one be true without the others also being true. Conflating these three patterns makes the latitudinal diversity gradient seem much more ubiquitous than it actually is. For example, latitudinal clines in species richness in Scandinavia are quite understandably described as latitudinal diversity gradients, but such studies say nothing about tropical vs. extra-tropical patterns.
