# Geographic Range Size

## Why study range size?

If we view the life history of species (or other taxonomic groups) as analagous to the ontogenetic development of an organism, then every species undergoes birth (origination), adolescence (geographic dispersal), reproduction (speciation), and death (extinction). Each of these "stages of life" is best expressed and studied via the lens of changes in geographic range size.

We know that geographic range size strongly affects the likelihood of speciation (i.e, allopatric speciation). We know that the environmental and ecological preferences of organisms (i.e., ecological niches) are expressed in terms of their geographic range size, and that taxa wax and wane in geographic range size as they meet with "success" and "failure". And, perhaps most importantly, we know that of all the proposed determinants of extinction (e.g., population size, fecundity, body size), only geographic range size has been definitively and consistently shown to be a strong predictor of extinction risk in *both* extant and fossil faunas.

In short, geographic range size is our best window into how *species* live and die.

## What data do I use to study geographic range size?

I use a broad suite of datasets to study geographic range size. This includes geographic range size dataset of extant taxa from the [Ocean Biogeographic Information System](www.iobis.org) and the [International Union for the Conservation of Nature](www.iucnredlist.org). Of course, as a paleobiologist, I also rely heavily upon the [Paleobiology Database](www.paleobiodb.org).

Last and perhaps most uniquely, I use the [Macrostrat Database](www.macrostrat.org) to analyze how the geographic range size of fossil species is related to both the quantity of preserved sedimentary rock and the paleogeography of ancient continents.
