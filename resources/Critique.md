# How to Critique

## Feedback on giving feedback
This past grant season I found myself in the unfamiliar position of critiquing graduate research grants rather than writing my own - a consequence of my recent ascension from lowly graduate student to post-doctorate. I like to think that I had plenty of useful insights to offer the next generation, but, in an ironic twist, I probably learned more from their feedback of my feedback than they did from my comments. Giving constructive criticism is a skill, as difficult and nuanced as writing, and one that I sense is insufficiently developed by most academics. I'm certainly not an expert, but I'd like to share what I've learned.

## Don't presuppose ignorance
>   Case 1: "You need to use Shareholder Subsampling Quorum when you standardize biodiversity time-series instead of rarefaction, read Alroy (2010) for an explanation.

>   Case 2: "Why didn't you use Shareholder Subsampling Quorum instead of rarefaction? Alroy (2010) argues that it is the superior method.

Both comments express the same information and concern. The student now knows they need to address a certain analytic technique in the manuscript, and they've been given direction on where they can learn more about it.

However, the first case automatically assumes the student is unfamiliar with the literature. That may be the case, but if it's not, then we've 1) implied we don't believe the student adequately reviews the literature (which will be a blow to their confidence) and 2) have expressed an absolute opinion, which makes it difficult for the student to explain their reasoning. The social barrier separating mentor and mentee already makes it difficult for students to speak their minds. Expressing comments as directives, rather than as questions, changes the scenario from a dialogue between peers to imperial fiat. It's much easier for the student to respond with, "I used rarefaction because Foote (2016) showed that rarefaction is the superior method with this type of data" in the second case compared to the first.

In a more general sense, don't automatically presuppose ignorance when dealing with students. If a student says or writes something seemingly nonsensical, it's easy to dismiss it as a sign of their inexperience. But, before launching into a potentially unnecessary lecture, pause and consider whether the student is suffering from a knowledge gap or a communications failure. The solution for each is different.

## Patronizing adverbs and phrases
    
>   Case 1: "*Obviously*, the realized niche cannot be larger than the fundamental niche."
    
>   Case 2: "The data are *clearly* biased towards small geographic ranges."
    
>   Case 3: "Well, *as we all know*, a lazarus taxon is absent from the fossil record for one or more intervals of it's geologic range."

Using these sorts of phrases brings to mind a Victorian era scientist lounging in an arm chair, drawling the words "hardly" and "quite", while taking big huffs from his snuff box. Nobody needs that. If it's really that obvious, then there's no need to say so. If it's not actually obvious, then it comes across as condescending.

## Praise and criticize in equal measure
The old advice of "praise, critique, praise" is pretty widespread at this point. I think it's not a bad idea, but perhaps a bit exaggerated. Offering praise and criticism at a 2:1 ratio every single time you make a comment is going overboard. 

It is important, however, to maintain an overall balance between positive and negative comments throughout the manuscript as a whole. Review comments before returning them. Does the tone seem to be a little one-sided? Go back and add some more compliments! In a similar vein, feel free to stamp your seal of approval on sections that are flawless too. Perfection deserves recognition.

## Be clear when demanding clarity
Arguably the most unforgivable sin (or at least the most ironic) is being vague when demanding further clarification. Unless if they're an absolute literary barbarian, a student won't submit something for review that they don't believe is, at minimum, cogent. Stating that a particular line, paragraph, or section is confusing provides no direction as to what needs further explanation or reworking. It was clear to them when they wrote it, and it will (likely) still be clear to them when they recieve the feedback. An explicit explanation of how the troublesome section was interpreted (and why it doesn't seem to make sense) is more useful.

I would argue that descriptive comments are superior to brusque ones even for simple things like grammatical errors. Noting that a line is grammatically incorrect isn't exactly useless, but nobody is going to develop carpel tunnel syndrome from taking the time to type out the corrected version.

## Resist the temptation to rewrite
If you're at the point in your career where you're regularly offering critiques, then you've probably already established your own writing style. That can make it hard to deal with a student's emerging style, especially if your own advisers indoctrinated you with the sacred belief that there is only one true way to write and heretics must be purged.

I don't believe that there is only one way to write, but even if you do, the way to handle things isn't by rewriting the student's work to match a predetermined style. It's their work, and the writing should ultimately - good or bad - reflect their vision. An adviser can (must) provide instruction and guidance, but at the end of the day we are not trying to overprint our voice onto theirs. This is not star trek, we are not the borg.

Besides, writing over their work doesn't teach them anything, and might breed resentment or damage their confidence. Providing light, but explicit, advice is more educational and will probably be less damaging to their delicate egos. I would also contend, though less strongly, that a lighter touch is also preferred when co-authoring papers with colleagues. Once its established that someone else is going to take the lead, then we need to accept that it is their voice that needs to be dominant.

## Don't obsess over "good" writing
This is perhaps my most controversial observation, and my opinion on the subject is still evolving. Nevertheless, I'm starting to believe that, in general, we're all a bit too obsessed with the idea of "good" writing.

There are two criteria that must be met in scientific writing: a coherent narrative and factual accuracy. I would argue that everything else is just a bonus once those conditions are met. Spending time hunting for things like passive voice, excessive use of first-person, and hanging prepositions is fine, but a lot of those "rules of good writing" are just fads and affectations. For example, nobody is going to go blind if you use the same phrase twice in the manuscript.

Put another way, wordsmithing seems, at least in some cases, to be more of an exercise in vanity than a requirement for effective scientific writing. If shakespearean eloquence is important to you as an author, then by all means, go for it. I'm just not sure it should be a significant priority when critiquing.
