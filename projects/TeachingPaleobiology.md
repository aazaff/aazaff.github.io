# Teaching Paleobiology

## Course Philosophy
My [paleobiology course](https://github.com/aazaff/teachPaleobiology/blob/master/README.md) is organized around the idea of *ontogeny*. Ontogenesis is a concept in biology that describes the anatomical and behavioral development of an organism from its birth to its death. In other words, it means progression through the successive stages of life as you age â€“ e.g., birth, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and death.

Paleobiology can be thought of as an extension of this idea, ontogeny, from individual organisms to species. Species are born into this world via abiogenesis or evolution from parent species; they grow in population size and geographic extent; and they eventually become extinct. If you understand the general processes governing the ontogenetic development of species and fossils, then you are equipped to hypothesize about the origins of any pattern you observe in the fossil record, whether or not you are familiar with the particulars of the place or time in question.

The course is split into two phases. In the first phase, we discuss the ontogeny of species and fossils in general terms. In the second phase, we proceed through successive periods in the history of complex animal life, and analyze the specific ontogenetic development of different evolutionary faunas. Evolutionary faunas are groups of species that evolved, dominated the globe, and became extinct around the same time. In other words, evolutionary faunas are the concept of ontogeny applied to groups of species.

## Course Skills
Most students that take a Paleobiology course will not continue onwards into academia. I consequently place a strong emphasis on transferable skills, especially data analyitics, in addition to [the theoretical framework](#course-philosophy). This includes downloading data sets, entering and editing data, and statistical analysis of those data. Ideally, at the end of the course, students are able to construct and test their own paleobiological hypotheses using available online databases. 

In particular, the course covers how to use the [R Statistical Program](https://github.com/aazaff/startLearn.R/blob/master/README.md), the [Paleobiology Database](www.paleobiodb.org), [GitHub](www.github.com), and the [Macrostrat Database](www.macrostrat.org). All of these services are free, available online, and work with Mac, Windows, or Linux systems. R is an especially powerful tool that is highly sought after in the [job market](http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends/R%2C%20CPA%2C%20Mechanic%2C%20MBA.html). Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as most major Universities and graduate programs are looking for R and git proficiency.

Students have a chance to demonstrate their mastery of these skills by writing a hypothetical [Geological Society of America](http://www.geosociety.org/grants/gradgrants.htm) graduate student research proposal towards the end of the class.

## GeoInformatics Initiative
My course and all of its publically available content is funded by the University of Wisconsin - Madison and the National Science Foundation. Our intention is to leverage the Paleobiology Database as part of the NSF Geoinformatics grant 0949416 (supplement) initiative for enhancing geoscience education. For this reason, all of the associated labs, lectures, and other materials are openly available to other paleobiology educators via GitHub. 

In addition, I am developing an [R package](https://github.com/aazaff/quantitativeFossils.R/blob/master/README.md) (software extension) for interfacing between R and the Paleobiology Database. This package makes downloading, culling, reshaping, and analyzing fossil data more convenient for both scientists and students, and is integrated into the freely available course materials.
